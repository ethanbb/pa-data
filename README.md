# You need
to have these on your computer

## nodejs

Use homebrew if you've got it (you'll know if you do). Installing globally is easiest.

If you don't know how to install it already, download it manually: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. It may get put in a hidden folder. We're trying to figure that out.

## git

Same kind of deal here.

Download here (https://git-scm.com/download/win) into the same folder as nodejs? We're working on figuring this out.

## halp us!

If you know sites with tutorials to do this better, let us know!


# Do
- make sure your computer isn't going to go to sleep
- plug your computer into power

## nodejs
- If you downloaded nodejs manually, find where it got installed on your computer. May be in a hidden folder. We're working on figuring that out.

## Get code
- go to https://github.com/knod/pa-data
- If you know how:
  - clone the repo
- If not:
  - click 'clone or download'
  - click 'download zip'?
  - extract folder
  - If you downloaded and extracted: put it where node is
  - If changes need to be made, you may end up doing this multiple times. Sorry :(
- go to extracted folder (pa-data)
- if it's not there already, add a folder called 'data-mdj'

## Command prompt/terminal
1. open command prompt
1. navigate into extracted folder
1. type: `npm install`
1. press enter
1. wait
1. type what michelle says to type (will be something like: `node mdj-names.js 6 10 15000`)
1. press enter
1. there will be a lot of errors that don't matter.
1. As long as the number after the text 'new pg at end' keeps changing, it's good.
1. Bad error looks like have this as their first line: Error: `Error: failed to find element matching selector "#ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_cphMain_cphDynamicContent_cphDynamicContent_participantCriteriaControl_lastNameControl"`
1. If that happens press `ctrl` and `C` at the same time, then message michelle

## If something is weird and you're not sure
don't hesitate to message michelle. She wants your sweet sweet messages.
