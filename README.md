# Warning
DO NOT SHARE THE DATA YOU GET OR PUT IT PUBLICLY ONLINE (like in a public repo). This is for analysis only and it will be anonymized.

# You need
to have these on your computer

## nodejs

Use homebrew if you've got it (you'll know if you do). Installing globally is easiest.

If you don't know how to install it already, download it manually: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. It may get put in a hidden folder. We're trying to figure that out.

## git

Same kind of deal here.

Download here (https://git-scm.com/download/win) into the same folder as nodejs? We're working on figuring this out.

## halp us!

If you know sites with tutorials to do this better, let us know!


# Do
- make sure your computer isn't going to go to sleep
- plug your computer into power

## nodejs
- If you downloaded nodejs manually, find where it got installed on your computer. May be in a hidden folder. We're working on figuring that out.

## Get code
- go to https://github.com/knod/pa-data
- If you know how:
  - clone the repo
- If not:
  - click 'clone or download'
  - click 'download zip'?
  - extract folder
  - If you downloaded and extracted: put it where node is
  - DO NOT DELETE THIS FOLDER
- if it's not there already, add a folder called 'data-mdj'

## Command prompt/terminal
1. open command prompt
1. navigate into extracted folder
1. type: `npm install`
1. press enter
1. wait
1. type what michelle says to type (will be something like: `node mdj-names.js 6 10 15000`)
1. press enter
1. this will take a long time
1. there will be a lot of errors that don't matter

## Errors to Worry About
There will be a bunch of errors. As long as the number after the text 'new pg at end' keeps changing, it's good.

Bad errors have this as their first line: Error: `Error: failed to find element matching selector "#ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_cphMain_cphDynamicContent_cphDynamicContent_participantCriteriaControl_lastNameControl"`

If that happens press `ctrl` and `C` at the same time, then message michelle


## Keeping Data

When your program is stopped
1. move data from the 'data-mdj' folder into one of your folders, wherever you prefer. Thumb drive is good if you don't want it on your machine.
1. *copy* the 'mdj-named-dockets-used.txt' into that folder too. Replace an older version if you need to.

## If something is weird and you're not sure
don't hesitate to message michelle. She wants your sweet sweet messages.
